# MGT665-LAB2
This is for Lab 2 submission of classification lab for Machine Learning

We will use a publicly found dataset on kaggle that contains information about students and grade points.

In this lab we will build and evaluate the following classification models using Python:
  -Logistic Regression
  -k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  -Decision Tree

The models will then be evaluated using the following metrics:
  -Accuracy
  -Precision
  -Recall
  -F1-Score
  *Classification_report from scikit-learn will be used to obtain these metrics.
